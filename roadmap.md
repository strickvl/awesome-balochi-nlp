# Roadmap for Balochi NLP

This is a non-exhaustive / incomplete list of some of the things for which work is needed for Balochi NLP:

## Short term mini-projects

- A custom-trained tokenizer (@strickvl working on this)
- A stopword list (and some other basic things like lists of characters/punctuation and their associated unicode code points etc)
- A conversion tool for language in different scripts
- Dialect classifier
- NER (named entity recognition) models
- Good quality dataset(s) that are openly available for all to use

## Medium - Long term goals / projects

- Embeddings
- Benchmarks
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) models (for generating audio)
- Speech-to-Text (STS) models (for transcribing audio)
- Language models (of various architectures)

## Potential partner organisations

Support could possibly come from leading organisations in the space. Importantly, they both have a strong track-record of encouraging and offering support for low-resource languages:

- Huggingface
- Explosion (makers of Spacy)
